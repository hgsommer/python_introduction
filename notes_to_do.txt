changes (to do):

order:
    * maybe bigger exercise? like compute/plot histogram of letter freqs.
    * add lesson 9-misc -> just mention prompts, exceptions, other ways of running
        maybe also more difficult exercise?

other ways of using python (not only jupyter)
(mainly mentioning this is possible)
    * script from terminal in Jupyter
    * ipython
    * IDE

exceptions
    * low prio: throw Exception("your input was wrong") as means of simple feedback
    
scripts:
    * example for script with arguments
    * screenshot for pycharm / spyder


before course:
send reminder email (including: room, time, GWDG account, maybe try to use login?)
check the wifi access point in the room
check if presenter & other equipment works
