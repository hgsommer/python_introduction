notes 

login at:
jupyter.gwdg.de with gwdg account

course material via terminal + git clone [url]

changes (to do):

order:
    * append dictionaries to 02-lists ?
        (done)
    * maybe bigger exercise? like compute/plot histogram of letter freqs.
    * add lesson 9-misc -> just mention prompts, exceptions, other ways of running
        maybe also more difficult exercise?


other ways of using python (not only jupyter)
(mainly mentioning this is possible)
    * script from terminal in Jupyter
    * ipython
    * IDE

exceptions
    * low prio: throw Exception("your input was wrong") as means of simple feedback

plotting (enlarge section?)
    * no change

before course:
send reminder email (including: room, time, GWDG account, maybe try to use login?)
check the wifi access point in the room
check if presenter & other equipment works
